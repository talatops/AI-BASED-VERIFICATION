## ðŸ“˜ User Stories

Each user story is formatted according to the typical format:  
As a [role], I want to [goal] so that [reason].

### 1. Identity Verification

- US1: As a user, I want to verify my identity using facial recognition so that I can securely access digital services.
- US2: As a user, I want to scan my government-issued ID so that the system can validate my identity against official documents.
- US3: As a system, I want to process identity checks in real-time so that fraudulent activity can be detected immediately.

### 2. Blockchain Integration

- US4: As a user, I want my identity data stored on a decentralized blockchain so that my information remains immutable.
- US5: As a system, I want to use smart contracts to automate identity verification so that manual oversight is minimized.
- US6: As a user, I want to control who accesses my identity data via blockchain-based permissions so that I maintain privacy.

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

- US7: As a system, I want to verify identity using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) so that I donâ€™t expose sensitive user data.
- US8: As a system, I want to compute on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption so that users' private data remains protected.
- US9: As a product owner, I want the system to comply with GDPR and CCPA so that the solution is legally deployable globally.

### 4. AI and Fraud Detection

- US10: As a system, I want to use machine learning to detect fraudulent identity attempts so that malicious actors are blocked.
- US11: As a security engineer, I want the AI models to update with new fraud patterns so that the system evolves with emerging threats.

### 5. User Interaction

- US12: As a user, I want a simple and intuitive user interface so that I can complete the identity verification process easily.
- US13: As a user, I want to be able to grant or revoke access to my data so that I have control over who sees my identity.

### 6. Interoperability

- US14: As a business partner, I want the system to integrate with our platform so that we can leverage verified identities in real-time.
- US15: As a developer, I want the system to support W3C DID standards so that it can interoperably work with global ID protocols.

## ðŸ“˜ Use Cases

Each use case includes: Title, Description, Actors, Preconditions, Flow (Main & Alternative), and Postconditions.

### UC1 â€” Biometric Identity Verification

- Description: User submits biometric data for identity verification.
- Actors: User, System  
- Preconditions:
  - User has access to a device with biometric input (e.g., camera or fingerprint scanner).
  - User is registered to use the system.
- Main Flow:
  1. User opens the verification interface.
  2. User submits biometric data (e.g., face scan).
  3. System validates data using pre-trained AI model.
  4. Verification result is returned to the user and optionally recorded on blockchain.
- Alternative Flow:
  - If biometric validation fails, user is prompted to retry or submit ID documents.
- Postconditions:
  - Identity is verified and tied to a blockchain-based identity record.

---

### UC2 â€” Government ID Verification

- Description: System verifies physical government-issued IDs.
- Actors: User, System
- Preconditions:
  - User must have a valid passport, driver license, or ID card.
- Main Flow:
  1. User takes photo or uploads scan of ID document.
  2. System extracts data using OCR and verifies issuing authority through APIs or AI.
  3. Cross-reference with biometric data (optional).
  4. Store result immutably on blockchain.
- Alternative Flow:
  - If the ID is expired or invalid, request re-submission.
- Postconditions:
  - A valid or rejected identity status is stored on the decentralized ledger.

---

### UC3 â€” Zero-Knowledge Identity Validation

- Description: Identity is confirmed without revealing private data.
- Actors: System, Verifier (e.g., 3rd Party Service)  
- Preconditions:
  - Identity is already verified and stored.
- Main Flow:
  1. Requestor asks for identity confirmation (e.g., "Is this user over 18?").
  2. System initiates ZKP protocol to prove claim without revealing DOB.
  3. Verifier receives confirmation of identity without access to raw data.
- Postconditions:
  - User stays anonymous, yet identity is validated securely.

---

### UC4 â€” Fraud Detection via AI

- Description: AI monitors and flags suspicious account activity.
- Actors: User, Fraud Detection System  
- Preconditions:
  - Users interact with the system regularly.
- Main Flow:
  1. User initiates identity verification.
  2. ML models analyze behavioral biometrics & metadata.
  3. System flags anomalies (e.g., spoofing).
  4. Alerts sent to admins or verification paused.
- Postconditions:
  - Fraudulent attempts are prevented and logged.

---

### UC5 â€” Decentralized Access Control

- Description: Users control who can access their identity data.
- Actors: User, 3rd Party Service  
- Preconditions:
  - ID profile is stored on blockchain.
- Main Flow:
  1. User navigates to access settings dashboard.
  2. User grants or revokes access to services using blockchain keys.
  3. Smart contract automates update on permission ledger.
- Postconditions:
  - Permissions are updated and logged immutably on-chain.

---

### UC6 â€” Interoperability With External Platforms

- Description: External platforms consume verified identity data via standards.
- Actors: 3rd Party Platform, ID System  
- Preconditions:
  - Platform supports interoperability standards (e.g., W3C DIDs).
- Main Flow:
  1. External application requests an identity verification token.
  2. User accepts access request.
  3. System sends contextual, anonymized proof.
  4. Platform uses data to grant or deny access.
- Postconditions:
  - Secure connection established between platform & ID system.

---

### UC7 â€” Audit & Compliance
