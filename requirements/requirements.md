### Project: Blockchain-Based AI for Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification.

---

#### 1. Functional Requirements  
These describe what the system must do to achieve its objectives.  

1.1 Identity Verification  
- FR1: The system shall verify user identities using biometric data (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprints).  
- FR2: The system shall support verification of government-issued IDs (e.g., passports, driverâ€™s licenses).  
- FR3: The system shall enable real-time identity verification with AI-driven fraud detection.  

1.2 Blockchain Integration  
- FR4: The system shall store identity data on a decentralized blockchain ledger to ensure immutability.  
- FR5: The system shall use smart contracts to automate verification processes.  
- FR6: The system shall allow users to control access to their identity data via blockchain-based permissions.  

1.3 Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms  
- FR7: The system shall implement zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify identities without exposing sensitive data.  
- FR8: The system shall use homomorphic encryption to perform computations on encrypted data.  
- FR9: The system shall comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations for data privacy.  

1.4 AI and Fraud Detection  
- FR10: The system shall employ machine learning models to detect anomalies and fraudulent activities.  
- FR11: The system shall continuously update AI models based on new threat patterns.  

1.5 User Interaction  
- FR12: The system shall provide a user-friendly interface for identity submission and verification.  
- FR13: The system shall allow users to grant/revoke access to their identity data.  

1.6 Interoperability  
- FR14: The system shall support integration with third-party platforms (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare).  
- FR15: The system shall follow industry standards for identity verification (e.g., W3C DID standards).

#### 2. Non-Functional Requirements  
These describe how the system should perform and its constraints.  

2.1 Security  
- NFR1: The system shall ensure end-to-end encryption for all identity data.  
- NFR2: The system shall prevent unauthorized access through multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- NFR3: The system shall undergo regular security audits and penetration testing.  

2.2 Performance  
- NFR4: The system shall process identity verification requests in under 5 seconds.  
- NFR5: The system shall handle at least 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.  

2.3 Scalability  
- NFR6: The system shall support horizontal scaling to accommodate growing user demand.  
- NFR7: The blockchain architecture shall use a scalable consensus mechanism (e.g., proof-of-stake).  

2.4 Usability  
- NFR8: The system shall have an intuitive interface with support for multiple languages.  
- NFR9: The system shall provide clear documentation for users and administrators.  

2.5 Compliance  
- NFR10: The system shall adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection laws.  
- NFR11: The system shall log all verification events for audit purposes.  

2.6 Reliability  
- NFR12: The system shall achieve 99.9% uptime.  
- NFR13: The system shall have a disaster recovery plan in place.

### Summary  
The functional requirements focus on core capabilities like identity verification, blockchain integration, AI-driven fraud detection, and privacy preservation. The non-functional requirements ensure the system is secure, scalable, performant, and compliant with global standards. Together, these requirements provide a comprehensive framework for developing a robust and user-friendly identity verification system.
